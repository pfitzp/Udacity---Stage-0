    <h1>Getting Started With HTML - Notes</h1>
    <b>Basics of the Web</b><br>
    The web is accessed on a <em>Computer/Web Browser</em>, which communicates through
    the <em>internet</em> via <em>HTTP</em> protocol to access files hosted on
    <em>servers</em>.  The majority of files hosted on these servers are <em>HTML</em> files
    or <em>HyperText Markup Language</em>.<br>
    <br>
    <b>HTML Basics</b><br>
    HTML files can contain four different things.<br>
    <br>
    - Text content - <em>What you see</em><br>
    - Markup - <em>What it looks like</em><br>
    - References to other documents - <em>Images, Videos, etc</em><br>
    - Links to other pages<br>
    <br>
    <b>Markup - Tags & Elements</b><br>
     HTML Markup is made up of Tags & Elements, which determines how your page looks.
     Each element generally contains an opening and closing tag, which surround content.
     Tags such as img (Images) and br (Break) do not contain a closing tag, and are called void tags.
     A good resource for all HTML tags and elements is <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">this page</a>.<br>
     <br>
     HTML elements are either inline or block.  A block element means the contents
     are all within an invisible block.<br>
     <br>
     <b>Document Structure</b><br>
     Making your code easy to read is a very important part of good programming, and making sure your
     code has good structure and indenting is a very big part of that.
